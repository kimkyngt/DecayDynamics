            Atomic ensembles constitute a dominant platform for realizing quantum interfaces between light and matter. In dense and ordered arrays, destructive interference in photon emission leads to the emergence of subradiant states, which are protected from radiative decay and have long lifetimes. This phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest recently, with work showing that collective emission can be used to realize improved quantum memories and atomic mirrors. These ideas strongly rely on one assumption: that atoms have a unique ground state. Our work discusses the survival of subradiance for atoms with complex internal structure. In particular, we unveil a different mechanism for subradiance, which crucially depends on entanglement, a radical departure from the physics of classical-dipole lattices or 2-level atom arrays.

            The optical properties of subwavelength arrays of atoms or other quantum emitters have attracted significant interest recently. For example, the strong constructive or destructive interference of emitted light enables arrays to function as nearly perfect mirrors, support topological edge states, and allow for exponentially better quantum memories. In these proposals, the assumed atomic structure was simple, consisting of a unique electronic ground state. Within linear optics, the system is then equivalent to a periodic array of classical dielectric particles, whose periodicity supports the emergence of guided modes. However, it has not been known whether such phenomena persist in the presence of hyperfine structure, as exhibited by most quantum emitters. Here, we show that waveguiding can arise from rich atomic entanglement as a quantum many-body effect and elucidate the necessary conditions. Our work represents a significant step forward in understanding collective effects in arrays of atoms with realistic electronic structure.},

“Second, the form of Heff illustrates that, in general, lowering one atom angular-momentum projection by q does not necessarily imply that another atom’s projection is raised by q (q′ 6= q), as q refers to the dipole matrix element and not the global polarization of the emitted photon (Fig. 1C)” (Asenjo-Garcia et al., 2019, p. 25505)

	abstract = {A fully quantum mechanical theory of cascade effects on Zeeman quantum beats is presented. The work is mainly concerned with the case of selective optical excitation of the upper level of the cascade, but beam-foil excitation is also considered. The analogous steady-state cascade process (Happer er a l )in a magnetic field is considered as well, focusing on the polarisation of the cascade light. Calculations are made for specific cascade processes in A r II. It is found that in the cases of optical excitation treated here, quantum beats are a significant feature of the cascade emitted light, at least for intermediate values of the magnetic field. When the Lande g factors for the upper and intermediate levels in the cascade are similar, the quantum beats persist to much higher magnetic fields (by an order of magnitude) than for the case where the g factors are dissimilar. No analogous distinctive behaviour occurs for the steady-state polarisation. It is also found that upper-level and intermediate-level beat frequencies occur in the cascade light intensity.},
